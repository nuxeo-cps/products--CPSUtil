 This script leverages the 'runalltests' script for cron jobs. The latter script
 must be on the PATH.

 Usage: watchdog <zope_path> [<cps_checkout>] [--fresh]

 it is assumed that <zope_path> is a Zope instance.
 in case <cps_checkout> is missing, <zope_path>/Products must be a CPS bundle
 checkout. Otherwise <zope_path>/Products is assumed to be a symbolic link to
 such a checkout. 

 The standard output of this script is empty in case of success, and made of
 the error log (test output for products having failing tests). This is meant
 to allow a command such as the following

   watchdog /home/zope/cps3full | mail -e -s "CPS 3 full tests are broken" cpsmaintainer@example.com
 
 The '--fresh' option will be interpreted ONLY IF <cps_checkout> is present.
 It has the effect of making a new fresh checkout (rm -r, svn co). 
 To avoid repeating <zope_path> in case the checkout is <zope_path>/Products,
 you can simply make <cps_checkout> explicitly empty:
    watchdog <zope_path> "" --fresh

 Otherwise, the checkout will be simply updated (svn up)
